1. Given a signal x(t) that is not strictly band limited. Devise a method for finding the sampling rate.

An example:
1. Generate a signal
x(t) = t + T   for  -T < t < 0
     = T-t     for  0 < t < T

2. Determine its fourier transform using the matlab function fft

3. Plot the fourier transform X(w) versus frequency and verify it is band limited or not

4. Now define a new way of deciding the bandwidth of the signal.
For example: the spectral width in which most of the energy resides. ("most of the" means 99%)

5. Next, based on this new bandwidth define the sampling rate.

6. Evaluate the fourier transform based on theoretical definition.
Compute the energies using the integral formula for energy and determine the location at which the partial energy is 99%.

Verify if the bandwidth values from the two methods agree.

Finally write a report with the code, figures and analysis sections.
